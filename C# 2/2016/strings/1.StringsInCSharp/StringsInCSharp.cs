/*
 * A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored
 * as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. There is no null-terminating 
 * character at the end of a C# string; therefore a C# string can contain any number of 
 * embedded null characters ('\0'). The Length property of a string represents the number of
 * Char objects it contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To access the individual 
 * Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object.
 Their default value is null. Strings are enclosed in quotation marks. Various text-processing operations 
 * can be performed using strings: concatenation (joining one string with another), splitting by a given 
 * separator, searching, replacement of characters and others. More information about text processing can
 * be found in the chapter "Strings and Text Processing" in which there is detailed explanation on what a 
 * string is, what its applications are and how we can use it.
 * important methods:
 *  - Substring
 *  - Length
 *  - ToString
 *  - Compare
 *  - Equals
 *  - Concat
 *  - IndexOf(string str)
 *  - IndexOf(string str, int startIndex)
 *  - str.Substring(int startIndex, int length)
 *  - str.Substring(int startIndex)
 *  - Split
 *  - ToLower()
 *  - ToUpper()
