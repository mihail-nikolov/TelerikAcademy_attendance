MyWebApi - ASP.NET Web API Fluent Testing Framework

MyWebApi is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence v3.
Basically:
 - If you create software that uses GPL, you must license that software under GPL v3
 - If you create software that uses GPL, you must release your source code
 - If you start with a GPL license, you cannot convert to another license
 - You cannot include MyWebApi in a closed source distribution under this license 

If you have a really-coolish-and-nice open source or 
just closed source commercial project and you want to
include MyWebApi in it, leave a question on the issues page at
https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyWebApi/issues and another license 
with the latest version of the library will be provided free of charge to you.
